 Tenzies Dice Game Utilizing React
 Originally developed by following a React Course on [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com).
 I have made my own additional features to Challenges such as.
 1. The addition of a Rollcounter on the bottom of the screen
 2. A best-score feature which saves the user's best score to localstorage
 3. Instead of the dice faces displaying decimal numbers, it has been changed so that they now display faces similar to actual die.
